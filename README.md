# Engrove Audio Engineering Toolkit

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/b4bbaf12-a4ea-49d6-956a-cd12fe736618/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/engrove/deploys)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

An open-source collection of interactive web-based tools for the DIY audio enthusiast, born out of the "95% overthinking" philosophy from the [Double Decker Madness Lenco Project](https://www.lencoheaven.net/forum/index.php?topic=45949.0).

The goal of this toolkit is to transform complex engineering principles into a dynamic, visual, and intuitive environment, allowing users to explore the trade-offs in audio design in real-time.

### **Live Application**

**Explore the toolkit live at: [engrove.netlify.app](https://engrove.netlify.app/)**

---

### **Current Modules**

#### 1. Tonearm Resonance Calculator
An interactive simulator for calculating a tonearm's effective mass and its resonant frequency when paired with a specific cartridge. This tool helps visualize the critical relationship between all physical parameters of a tonearm's design.

### **Getting Started (For Local Development)**

To run this project locally, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Engrove/Turntable.git
    cd Turntable
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173/` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

### **Disclaimer**

This toolkit is provided as a design aid for theoretical exploration and educational purposes. The calculations are based on established physics, but are subject to the following limitations:
-   **Theoretical Nature:** The results are theoretical and do not account for all real-world variables, such as manufacturing tolerances, material inconsistencies, or environmental factors.
-   **No Guarantee of Accuracy:** While developed with care, this tool is a hobbyist project. There is no guarantee of the absolute accuracy of the calculations.
-   **User Responsibility:** Users are encouraged to cross-reference the results with their own measurements and practical experience. The ultimate responsibility for any physical build rests with the user.
