# Netlify Build Trigger

This file is used to manually trigger Netlify deployments.

Due to the [build.ignore] configuration in netlify.toml, Netlify will ONLY build and deploy the site when this specific file (buildtrigger.txt) is modified and pushed to the repository.

You can make any code changes in your project and push them. Those changes will NOT trigger a build until you also modify this file.

To trigger a new deployment:
1. Open this file.
2. Make any small change (e.g., add a new line, a space, or update the date below).
3. Save, commit, and push this file.

This helps conserve build minutes by giving you full control over deployments.
